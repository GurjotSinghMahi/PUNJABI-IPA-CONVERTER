PUNJABI-IPA-CONVERTER IS A UTILITY SOFTWARE WHICH CONVERTS THE PUNJABI WORDS TO ITS EQUIVALENT IPA FORMAT

THE PUNJABI IPA CONVERSION SOFTWARE PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO CONVERT THE PUNJABI WORDS
OR CHARACTERS TO ITS EQUIVALENT IPA CHARACTERS.

THIS PIECE OF CODE WAS WRITTEN AS A UTILITY, DURING WRITING MY RESEARCH PAPER,
WHERE I HAVE TO DEALT WITH LOT OF PUNJABI WORDS AND HAVE TO MENTION ITS EQUIVALENT
IPA FORMAT WORDS

I HOPE THIS WILL HELP MY FELLOW RESEARCHERS AND OTHER PEOPLE AS A UTILITY.
